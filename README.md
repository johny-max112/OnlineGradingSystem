The Online Grading System is a web-based application being developed to provide a modern approach for schools in managing students grades and academic communication. It allows students to easily view their grades, while professors and administrators can manage academic records and maintain accurate grading data efficiently and securely.

Many schools still rely on manual methods for managing student grades, which often results in delays, errors, and confusion between students and professors/instructors. This project aims to address these issues by creating a user-friendly student grading website where instructors can input or update grades, also the administrators can manage user accounts to ensure accuracy and security, and students can view their grades.

The target users of this system are students, professors or instructors, and administrators of a school organization. Students can benefit from this system in ways that they can view and access their grades, which their professors have uploaded. Professors can input or edit their studentsâ€™ grades. Administrators can add or delete students records and professors or instructors information.

Platform choice: Web Application (Node.js + React) 

Technologies used: Node.js, React.js, MySQL (XAMPP), GitHub, VS Code, 


II. Objectives

      The general objective of this project is to develop a secure, efficient and user-friendly web-based grading system that simplifies the process of managing student grades and academic records, while enhancing communication between students, professors, and administrators.

Specifically, the system aims to provide an intuitive frontend with the use of React, and build a scalable backend using Node.js to handle or process students, professors and administrators important data. The system will be utilizing a MySQL database, managed through XAMPP, in order to store academic records safely and securely. The system supports the implementation of CRUD operations in handling student information, grades, and user accounts. To ensure the appropriate permissions and maintain data integrity across the system's user, role-based access will be implemented.GitHub will be utilized in the making of the system for version control and collaboration of the team. Lastly, the system will be hosted and tested locally with the integration of XAMPP to simulate a real-world deployment.
